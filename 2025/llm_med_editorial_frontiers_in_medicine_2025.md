## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping how medicine processes and communicates information. This editorial introduces a Research Topic that surveys clinical decision support, diagnostics, patient-facing tools, education and training, documentation assistance, and synthetic clinical text generation. Across studies, newer models show strong performance in information retrieval and structured support, yet they remain decision aids rather than autonomous systems. Ethical and operational risks—accuracy, bias, privacy, and over‑reliance—require transparent methods, human oversight, and rigorous evaluation. The collection highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and sets priorities for responsible innovation as healthcare teams integrate LLMs into practice while safeguarding patient well‑being and evidence quality.
