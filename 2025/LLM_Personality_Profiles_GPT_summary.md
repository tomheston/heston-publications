## Abstract
LLMs are entering clinical contexts for support, CBT, triage, and diagnosis. We evaluate personality expression in a medical setting using two validated instruments and quantify between-model differences to assess safety and suitability for patient-facing use.

## Methods
Four public LLMs (Apr 2024)—ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini Advanced, Claude 3 Opus, Grok (Regular)—were tested once per model per instrument in fresh sessions to avoid carryover. Instruments: Open Extended Jungian Type Scales (OEJTS) and Big Five Personality Test. Primary analysis: one-way MANOVA across model profiles.

## Results
Significant inter-model differences (Wilks’ Λ=0.115, p<0.001). Typical OEJTS tendencies observed: ChatGPT-3.5 ≈ ENTJ; Claude 3 Opus ≈ INTJ; Gemini Advanced and Grok leaned INFJ. Big Five patterns: Gemini lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness; Claude highest conscientiousness and emotional stability; Grok higher openness with more variability. Effect sizes ranged from moderate to large.

## Conclusions
Distinct, reproducible personality profiles appear across LLMs. Clinical deployments should incorporate personality evaluation and governance, especially in mental-health applications.

## Key terms
OEJTS: type-based personality inventory.  
Big Five: trait model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism).  
MANOVA: multivariate test for group differences across correlated outcomes.

## Applications
Model selection for patient-facing tools; guardrails for counseling/CBT chat; periodic re-testing after model updates; documentation for IRB and safety reviews.

## Reproducibility notes
Test window: April 2024. New chat per run to prevent memory effects. Instruments administered per public protocols. Future work: multi-run averaging and inter-version tracking.
