## Abstract
Apologies to patients are standard in medicine, supported by ethics, training, and laws to reduce malpractice risks. However, apologies among colleagues are uncommon, despite harms from hierarchy, bullying, and dismissive behaviors. This perspective, based on personal experience in primary care and literature on workplace conflict, highlights barriers to colleague apologies. It critiques current models for lacking prevention and introduces the Acknowledge–Repair–Prevent (ARP) framework, incorporating restorative justice to promote shared accountability over power dynamics. ARP could restore trust, reduce burnout, and cultivate deep respect among colleagues in medicine.
