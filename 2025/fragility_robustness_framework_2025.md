## Abstract
Statistical evidence quality assessment requires metrics beyond p-values. This reference establishes a complete, model-free framework with two orthogonal dimensions scaled identically 0–1: Fragility (fr) measures the proportion of relevant data (or SE-scale shift) required to flip significance classification, with primary metrics MFQ (recommended default for 2×2 binary outcomes), GFQ (gold standard for r×c and multinomial), DFQ (diagnostic benchmarks), CFQ (continuous outcomes via Welch t-geometry), and PFI (fixed-margin designs). Robustness (nb) quantifies geometric distance from therapeutic neutrality via the Neutrality Boundary Framework (NBF), with primary metrics RQ (binary/multinomial), DNB (diagnostic odds ratio), MeCI (continuous means), DTI (correlation), Agreement-NBF (raw agreement), and ANOVAη² (multi-group). All metrics use only observed counts or published summary statistics; no raw data, simulation, reconstruction, or covariate models permitted. This document finalizes the integration of continuous-outcome measures (CFQ + MeCI) and the unified fr/nb notation, providing a complete evidence-quality system applicable to every standard study design with minimal assumptions.
