## Abstract

The fragility index quantifies statistical fragility by counting outcome changes needed to reverse statistical significance, but depends on arbitrary event definitions and toggle rules that may not find the actual minimum perturbation. The Global Fragility Index (GFI) is a path-independent measure identifying the minimum number of observation moves across all possible paths in a contingency table. Defined as the minimum number of single-observation moves between cells (with total N fixed) required to reverse statistical significance at α=0.05, the GFI evaluates all possible cell-to-cell moves to identify the true global minimum. Unlike the fragility index (FI), which toggles outcomes within a single arm using predetermined rules, the GFI removes three key dependencies: event/non-event labeling ambiguity, reference arm selection in balanced designs, and toggle path rules. By definition, GFI ≤ FI since it finds the global minimum while FI follows a predetermined path. The GFI naturally extends to multi-group comparisons using Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests for r×c tables. The Global Fragility Quotient (GFQ = GFI/N) normalizes for sample size. Worked examples from recent trials demonstrate how the GFI provides more sensitive fragility assessment by calculating the global minimum perturbation required to flip statistical significance. The GFI represents unconstrained optimization—asking "what is the smallest change to the data that would alter the conclusion?"—making it the theoretically optimal measure of statistical fragility for contingency tables.
