## Abstract

The Neutrality Boundary Framework (NBF) introduces a geometric approach to quantifying statistical robustness as normalized distance from the neutrality boundary—the manifold where effect equals zero. The framework produces a threshold-free, sample-size invariant measure nb ∈ [0,1) that complements traditional effect sizes and p-values. The general form nb = |Δ−Δ₀|/(|Δ−Δ₀|+S) is proven to be bounded, monotonic, and sample-size invariant when Δ and S represent population-level quantities. Domain-specific implementations include the Risk Quotient for binary outcomes (generalizing to r×c contingency tables), partial η² for ANOVA, and Fisher z-based measures for correlation. Unlike threshold-dependent fragility indices that identify minimum outcome changes to cross p=0.05, NBF quantifies robustness geometrically across arbitrary significance levels and statistical contexts. The framework maintains distributional integrity while providing unified robustness assessment independent of significance testing conventions.
