## Abstract

Empirical claims about gun policy often enter courtrooms and legislative hearings framed through p-values and confidence intervals. Those conventions were not designed to answer the legal questions that matter most: whether a proposition is more likely than not to be helpful, and how stable that conclusion is under small perturbations of the data. This article proposes two diagnostics for firearm policy evidence: the Percent Fragility Index and the Risk Quotient. The Percent Fragility Index reports the minimum percentage of observed outcomes that would have to change to reverse a study's statistical significance under conventional criteria for p-values and confidence intervals. This helps determine how confident we can be that a p-value < 0.05 is meaningful. The Risk Quotient completely removes any reliance on p-values, and instead reports the minimum percentage of outcomes that would have to change to eliminate any claimed benefit of the law. Together these measures translate statistical uncertainty into legally relevant information about reliability and probative value, giving courts and policymakers clearer guidance for admissibility and for the weight to assign to contested studies.
