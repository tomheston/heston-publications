## Abstract

This pragmatic observational study validates the p-fr-nb framework for stratifying statistical evidence quality in clinical trials. Among 129 two-arm binary-outcome trials across 15 specialties, 77 were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). The study introduces complete statistical evidence as a triplet: p-value (significance), fragility quotient (classification stability), and robustness metric (distance from neutrality). Monte Carlo simulation of 720,000 trials established null expectations. Results showed 39.0% of significant trials met concordant-positive criteria (stable + strongly robust), a 27.9-fold elevation over null expectations (p < 0.0001). Conversely, 31.2% exhibited the significant-fragile-weak pattern (p ≤ 0.05, fragile classification, weak robustness). Overall, 61.0% of significant trials were fragile (MFQ ≤ 0.10) and 31.2% were weakly robust (RQ < 0.075). The framework reveals heterogeneity in evidence quality invisible to p-values alone, supporting incorporation of fragility and robustness metrics into clinical trial reporting standards.
