## Summary
This letter responds to Brown et al's article on the statistical fragility of tranexamic acid (TXA) use in orthopaedic surgery. While commending the use of the fragility index (FI) and fragility quotient (FQ), the letter introduces the Relative Risk Index (RRI) and Risk Quotient (RQ) as complementary metrics that assess therapeutic equivalence rather than statistical significance thresholds. The RRI focuses on global changes across study groups and provides clinically relevant information independent of p-value changes, making it particularly valuable for assessing whether research findings represent meaningful therapeutic differences.

## Key Points
- The FI and FQ identify minimal changes needed to alter statistical significance but rely on arbitrary 0.05 cutoff values
- The RRI measures distance from therapeutic neutrality (RR = 1.0) without p-value dependency
- Using Brown et al's example data, the RRI demonstrates that a 30% increase in transfusions represents robust findings
- The RQ (normalized RRI) provides intuitive percentage-based interpretation across different study designs
- The RRI complements FI/FQ by focusing on therapeutic equivalence and clinical decision-making
