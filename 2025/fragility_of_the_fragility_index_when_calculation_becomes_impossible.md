## Abstract

The Fragility Index (FI) measures statistical robustness by quantifying the minimum number of outcome changes required to alter significance. Despite widespread adoption across medical specialties, the FI exhibits systematic computational failures in common clinical trial scenarios. This study analyzed 14 representative 2×2 contingency tables spanning rare events, balanced small samples, and extreme imbalances. The FI was not attainable in all 14 cases (0% success rate) due to discrete integer constraints and Fisher's exact test limitations. Alternative metrics demonstrated superior reliability: Risk Quotient (RQ) and Percent Fragility Index (PFI) achieved universal computability (100% success), while Robustness Index (RI) computed in 86% of cases. The RQ quantifies distance to therapeutic neutrality on a bounded 0–1 scale, providing clinically interpretable values independent of arbitrary significance thresholds. The PFI quantifies percentage change needed to flip statistical significance using continuous outcome adjustments. These findings demonstrate that the FI itself exhibits fragility precisely where robustness assessment is most critical. Researchers should prioritize RQ and PFI as primary fragility metrics for evidence assessment in clinical trials.
