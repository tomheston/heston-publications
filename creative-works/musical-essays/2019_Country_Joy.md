## Abstract

Country Joy is an original composition for voice and piano that emerged spontaneously during a twilight moment before dawn. The piece reflects on the universal nature of joy—how it transcends circumstance and profession, residing deep within rather than in external trappings. Through the metaphor of wanting to be a cowboy or cowgirl, the song explores how country joy exists everywhere and fills daily life regardless of one's actual background or occupation. The accompanying commentary reflects on the song's mysterious origins and its message that all human activity—from medicine to custodial work—can be ennobled by an unshakable faith in the goodness of life. The composition includes three verses, two refrains with country dance elements (LEFT RIGHT, dos-ey-do), and concludes with a spiritual reference to Jesus blessing the children (Mark 10:16). Written in C major with a simple chord progression (C-F-G7), the piece is accessible for community performance and congregational singing.
