## Abstract
A personal narrative essay combining prose, poetry, and original music that chronicles the author's experience with homelessness as a college student during the winter of 1983 in Seattle. The work explores themes of economic instability, isolation, resilience, and human connection through the lens of lived experience. Written as a performance piece, the essay integrates spoken narration with three original songs ("Two Left Shoes," "Searching," and "Through the Cold Weather") and multiple poems to convey the emotional and physical realities of housing insecurity. The narrative extends beyond personal memoir to examine broader societal issues, including the prevalence of student homelessness (5-10% of college students), the critical role of social connection in survival, and the importance of recognizing individuals experiencing homelessness by name rather than diagnosis or label. The work concludes with a call for kindness, compassion, and concrete action to support community members facing housing insecurity.
