## Artist Statement

Quantum entanglement describes how two particles can be linked together in spite of a separation of billions of light-years of space. Although this phenomenon is an observable scientific finding, does it also explain our deep connections with other people, with nature, with everything we love? Quantum theory may just possibly explain how we experience these connections that persist beyond time.

When I was an intern at Cape Fear Valley Hospital in North Carolina, one of my patients passed away. While the death was not unexpected, nevertheless, it profoundly affected me. When discussing this with the unit clerk of the hospital wing, she simply told me that my patient had gone to a better place. Not dead. Not the end. Just to a better place. Although my religious faith believed in life after death, her great, unshakable certainty surprised me. She taught me a lifelong lesson. The love entanglements we have supersede life and death.

*Find the Joy* reflects on a lifetime of experiences where as a physician I've had to intimately face and share with others great tragedy, pain, and suffering. How can we find the strength and the peace to go on? How can we get past grief and keep our spirits strong and intact? It's challenging.

I believe that love is the most powerful force in the universe, that it overcomes everything, and that it has both a spiritual and scientific basis. Quantum field theory seems to explain just how waves of love can transcend space and time. And our spirits can sense this. We can feel these timeless connections of love, these inescapable entanglements.

As the French Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin said, we are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience. So as we realize that our spirit is our core essence, we find meaning in spite of sadness. From the ashes of tragedy sparks an eternal flame.

*Find the joy. It's still there.*

## Companion Poem: "An Ode to Healing in F Major"

*The physician comes in, stethoscope swinging,*  
*As Bach flows gently, each note softly rings.*  
*Waveforms intertwine, particles dance,*  
*Melodies mending, quantum chance bending.*  

*Music and medicine, interplaying,*  
*Sickness and health, balancing, swaying.*  
*Science and art, together healing,*  
*Rhythm and reason, suffering unfeeling.*  

*With quarks and bandages, we seek restoration,*  
*Through sharps and flats, finds the patient's elation.*  
*So let us be grateful for knowledge and song,*  
*Two noble callings, humanity making strong.*  

*Though the mysteries of life remain long unfurled,*  
*With care and compassion, we can heal the world.*  
*So doctors, pick up your well-tuned strings!*  
*Make new cures resound, hope and solace bring.*
