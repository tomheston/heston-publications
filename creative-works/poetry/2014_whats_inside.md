## Abstract
A reflective poem exploring the dual nature of medical imaging—the technical precision of diagnostic scans contrasted with the profound human experience of illness, mortality, and the physician-patient relationship. The work examines the tension between clinical objectivity and emotional reality when delivering difficult diagnoses, using nuclear medicine imaging as metaphor for revealing what lies beneath the surface of human experience.
